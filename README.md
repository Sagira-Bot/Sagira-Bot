# Sagira-Bot

TODO: Write this readme.

In the meantime, all you need to know for this project is the need to put a .env file in your binaries folder (or edit the Env.Load calls to point to wherever you want your env file).

Format of that file: 

APIKEY=
BTOKEN=
PREFIX=!
LOG=DEBUG.log
LOGDIR=Logs

APIKEY -> Bungie's API Key.
BTOKEN -> Discord Bot Token.
Prefix -> Server Prefix
LOG -> Bungie.Driver/Sagira objects log to this file.
LOGDIR -> Log above stored here.
