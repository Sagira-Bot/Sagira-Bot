TODO: Write this readme.

In the meantime, all you need to know for this project is the need to put a .env file in your binaries folder (or edit the Env.Load calls to point to wherever you want your env file).

Format of that file: Plaintext file with each of these entries on their own lines.

* APIKEY=
* BTOKEN=
* PREFIX=!
* LOG=DEBUG.log
* LOGDIR=Logs

# Envs
* APIKEY -> Bungie's API Key.
* BTOKEN -> Discord Bot Token.
* Prefix -> Server Prefix
* LOG -> Bungie.Driver/Sagira objects log to this file.
* LOGDIR -> Log above stored here.
